## About Website

Hugo Website using [Hugo Book Template](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-book/).

The purpose of the website is to 1. display information about the Hackathon to all participants during hackathon 2. act as a homebase for contributing to writing an article up for publication after the hackathon.

## About Hackathon

Researchers, scientific journals, and data repositories have increasingly focused on scientific data being more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). Yet, a large number of new publications within ecology and evolution still lack adherence to FAIR code and data-sharing policies (Culina et al. 2020).

GitHub is a popular version control platform that can be leveraged for sharing code and data, yet the learning curve may deter first-time users in EEB. In this hackathon, we will share, discuss, and brainstorm innovative ways to use GitHub for collaboration and sharing information that aligns with research and career goals for EEB researchers.

‘GitHub hesitancy’ due to conflation of Git and GitHub. People may overestimate the conceptual leap from their current collaborative approaches to GitHub speeds up and democratizes sharing of knowledge at all stages of research Reduces redundant work across research groups.
