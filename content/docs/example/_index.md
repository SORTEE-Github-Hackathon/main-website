Breakout room details:
Choose from one of 5 breakout rooms:
1) visualizing data and results
2) career-supporting resources
3) research documentation
4) programming and code support
5) dynamic collaboration

*within* each breakout room, we'll cover the following areas:
Step 1: Presentation of the breakout room topic
Step 2: Exposition of examples OR individual/collective practices (?)
Step 3: Discussion and summary of challenges;
Step 4: Return of participants and organizers to the main workshop room

*within* each breakout room, consider the following discussion questions:
1) What other tools have you used for this purpose?
2) How does GitHub compare to other tools you've used for this purpose?
3) What are the main challenges in using GitHub for this purpose?
4) What are the main benefits of using GitHub over some other tool?
5) What could be done to improve GitHub for this purpose?

Breakout room topics (goal: building content areas for the manuscript): 1) visualizing data and results; 2) career-supporting resources; 3) research documentation; 4) programming and code support; 5) dynamic collaboration
     
01h30m to 01h45m: Break (?)
01h45m to 02h15m: Summary of break-out room discussions;

What questions do we want to address during the discussion?
1) How often do you see GitHub being used in these ways in ecology and evolution? 
2) Do you think ecology and evolution would be improved with more usage of these tools? In what ways? 
3) What parts of ecology and evolution are beyond the scope of these tools? 
4) What parts of ecology and evolution are put at risk by these tools? *maybe a weird question, but could get at concerns people have about scooping/data security and ways of dealing with this*
5) (*If you work in Eco/Evo*) Would you consider using GitHub for any of your current or future projects, or recommend it to your colleagues? If so, what would you most want to use it for (visualisation, documentation, etc.)?

02h15m to 02h30m: General discussion and summary;
02h30m to 02h45m: Closure with plan for the upcoming weeks + survey (?).
Writing time
(The extra 15 minutes can be used to adjust to the other sections)
