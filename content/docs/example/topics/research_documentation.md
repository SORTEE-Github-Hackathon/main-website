#### We'll cover the following topics:  
Step 1: Presentation of the breakout room topic   
Step 2: Brief tutorial and time for individual practice  
Step 3: Discussion and summary of challenges  
Step 4: Return of participants and organizers to the main workshop room  

## Examples / References that display research documentation, data, and results

Use of displaying notebooks as experiments on Github
-  Team working on optimization of a neural network: https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA/team_neural_network/tree/master/code/experiments
-  "Toolchain walkthrough" for organising data for systematic review: https://github.com/softloud/sysrevdata (https://softloud.github.io/sysrevdata/)

Working on a team using Github Organizations
-  Overarching research team that works on multiple projects. Seperating projects that range from experiments to software: https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA
-  An ugly example of team working: https://github.com/LivingNorway

Hosting website to work on research publicly 
-  Organization that shares tutorials and research. Each project will evolve into a "post" on website https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity
- Website: https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity/cabinetofcuriosity_site

Documentation of data standards
-  https://github.com/ess-dive-community

Archival of code and results for papers
-  Largely non-computational project. Code was just used to analyze resutls and create graphs: https://github.com/iamciera/sister-of-pin1-material/blob/master/cosegregation/readme.md

- Largely Computational Project: https://github.com/iamciera/lcmProject


Learning Github

#### Discussion questions:
1. What other tools have you used for this purpose?
    - Sharing files back and forth
    - Microsoft Office with track changes
    - OSF R package
2. How does GitHub compare to other tools you've used for this purpose?
    - Harder to get some collaborators on board
    - Smaller file size limits
    - Undergrads can be the best adopters, helping with data tidying (no habits), one workshop at the beginning
    - microsoft owns github
    - size limits actually quite large on OSF
3. What are the main challenges in using GitHub for this purpose?
    - Making sure everyone on team is willing to use
    - Size limits
    - Certain file types have cryptic 'diff' documentation in Github
    - large corporation owning code
    - terminology not consistent across programs
    - Working with a team with varying skill levels and associated challenges
    - seems like a big step relative to track changes in MS word - some collaborators still reluctant to even use Google drive
4. What are the main benefits of using GitHub over some other tool?
    - Making sure all collaborators are using the same version
    - Example of a microsoft access database- collaborating with several students including undergrads 
5. What could be done to improve GitHub for this purpose?
    - Glossary of terms put into user-friendly language
    - teaching git starting with 5 commands, not overwhelming with all vocabulary
    - teasing apart which software engineering principles are needed for researchers, vs. what should be delegated to a software engineering role within a research team
    - Explain to students that it's very hard to 'break' it
    - Starting with low stakes projects
    - Make learning project-based
    - You don't have to use github if you use git: Gitlab instead of Github, but same fallbacks. Gitlab offered free private repos
    - When teaching Git/Github, it's important not to transfer hesitancy to students -- helpful to model behaviour of not needing to be an expert and making mistakes
## Misc discussion

- Some members seeing big disjunct between their willingness to adopt new technology relative to PIs - writing manuscripts as markdown documents, converting into word, getting back track changes and implementing manually
- github pilot - helps autocomplete code, took everyone's code and did ML including all license types
- people like software developers experience more top down support/pressure to adopt, whereas researchers usually working from bottom up
- dealing with big files - splitting and binding big files can help
- adding releases helps get around file size restrictions - unlimited file size
- osf R package as an alternative for written components of projects, scripts go onto github
- As a minimum situation where no new software needs to be learned - build timestamp into all documentation (including data download)
- most software engineers don't store data either locally or online -- this is why there is a limit
