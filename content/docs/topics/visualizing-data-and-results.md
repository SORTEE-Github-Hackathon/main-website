## Presentation of the breakout room topic 

Questions I am interested in:

-  How do we use Github to display our data and results? Notebooks, Websites, ect
-  How do we build our Github repositories and organizations for displaying our work to our team or community? Directory structure, documentation, ect
-  Github vs Other venues? Is Github even right for this?  

## Exposition of examples OR individual/collective practices 

-  Use of displaying notebooks as experiments on Github
	-  Example: https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA/team_neural_network/tree/master/code/experiments
-  Working on a team using Github Organizations
	-  Example:  https://github.com/DiscoveryDNA
