What are the main benefits of using GitHub over some other tool? What could be done to improve GitHub for this purpose?

(Examples can be useful to include in manuscript outline) Do you think ecology and evolution would be improved with more usage of these tools? In what ways? What parts of ecology and evolution are beyond the scope of these tools? And provide example (e.g., _____ is a better platform for _____.) What parts of ecology and evolution are put at risk by these tools? e.g. concerns about scooping/data security (If you work in Eco/Evo) Would you consider using GitHub for any of your current or future projects, or recommend it to your colleagues? If so, what would you most want to use it for (visualisation, documentation, etc.)?

Check out our padlet responses here!\nWorking with EcoEvo people it is apparent that the use of GitHub is predicated by the use of R and other programming languages. Instead of using 3rd party data management. A lot of emphasis in R based tools, but highlight all the things that you can do on GitHub that have nothing to do with R.\nThere is reluctancy from students and PIs or collaborators in using GitHub. Reasons:\n lack of time, not worth the effort. Baby steps to start using GitHub: Example: \u0026ldquo;Learn how to use issues first.\u0026rdquo;  Make clear that it is really hard to make mistakes on GitHub.\nDemoing the benefits of learning and all the time that you will eventually save if you learn. Initial investment is hight byt payoff is really high too.\nThere are so many tools available and it is hard to choose.\nFear of getting in touch with a new language.\nIt is not taught in colleague yet as a basic course.\nTop down resistence as opposed to bottom up resistence.\nMany things can be done from the desktop graphical user interface.\nPIs afraid to be scooped. Solutions:\n Private repo, going public upon publication. Licensing. Terms of use. You actually have premise once you publish it. You wil have more citations.  Fear of being so open, kind of vulnerable, everybody will see all your errors.\nDifference between code peer review and paper peer review. One is easier than the other\nEco-evo specific version of https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510\nMethods in Ecology and Evolution.\nhttps://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13652\nNo body really knows all the possibilities that GitHub has to offer.\nMaybe make a chart of tools, list what they have to offer and then compare to GitHub.\nGoal: take the angle of things that you can do with version control, either GitHub or any other tool.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/example/topics/programming-and-coding/","title":"Programming and Coding","section":"Topics","content":"Programming and Coding #  This document serves as a place holder for content that will be collaboratively created at Hackathon. link to hack.md doc\nPresentation of the breakout room topic Step #  Exposition of examples OR individual/collective practices #  Discussion and summary of challenges #  Return of participants and organizers to the main workshop room #  Questions for Group #  What other tools have you used for this purpose?

Getting set up #   Make a Github account Download the Github Desktop App (optional) Create an OSF account (optional) Create a Research Data Management Plan for your project  2. Using GitHub desktop #  2.1 creating a repo #   In the left pane, select Add to create a new repository Choose Create new repository and give the path to a new project folder (or fork this one via Clone, or add an existing folder).  I keep all my repos in my OneDrive.1in a folder called Github  1. Some people say not to do this because it causes OneDrive to constantly sync small Github files, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to cause me any trouble, and it helps me avoid accidentally deleting things when I make mistakes with GitHub Desktop. see here for at least one other person who does this Choose a License that reflects the reuse conditions you\u0026rsquo;d like for your project (see here for a description of licenses available) Initialize the repo with a README that you will fill following the Metadata tips in section 4. to ensure reproducibility If necessary, change the privacy settings of your repo on the Github website (storage limits are lower for private repositories). If the repo does not yet exist online, make sure you Publish it.  2.2 Your first commit! #   You can manually open your files as usual, but you can also use the Repository tab to open your files all at once in a text editor (I set my default to Sublime) Try make a small change to one of your files, or create a new file. If you navigate back to Github desktop, there should be evidence of a changed/new file  If you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with your changes, type a commit message (or use the default for a single file change) and press Commit to main Send your changes to Github\u0026rsquo;s server by pressing Push to origin  Your changes should now be reflected on the online version of your repo! NOTE: There should be a Git pane in the top right of newer versions of RStudio when you\u0026rsquo;re working in an R Project contained within a Github repo, and using it to Push and Commit works similarly to Github Desktop.  2.3 Pulling online changes to your machine #    Now, try changing a file on the online repo (e.g. using the pencil icon to update the README)\n  Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of the Commit menu after I edited the README -\n  You may need to click \u0026lsquo;Fetch origin\u0026rsquo; to see your changes   Now Pull   Now your local computer should be up to date with the online repo!\n  NOTE: There should be a Git pane in the top right of newer versions of RStudio when you\u0026rsquo;re working in an R Project contained within a Github repo, and using it to pull works similarly to Github Desktop.\n  3. Linking GitHub with OSF #   Create a new OSF project  Or use a template (My lab has started following this basic template)  Use a program like DMP Assistant to add a Research Data Management Plan to the RDMP section of the OSF project Add GitHub as an Add-on in your OSF profile in Settings\u0026raquo; Select add-ons  Link GitHub with your OSF account in the Add-ons section of the relevant project components (e.g. Analysis)  Select Import Account from Profile  Select the corresponding repo for the project     4. Some reproducibility tips (largely taken from the Bennett Lab manual compiled by Jaimie Vincent) #    Data management and storage\n Starting any research project with an RDMP provides direction for conducting research in line with Open Science/FAIR practices. Data and code should be backed up regularly, using the “3-2-1” rule as a rule of thumb - this means having three copies of your data (your working copy and two backups) on two different formats (e.g., cloud storage and disk storage) with at least 1 off-site copy for disaster recovery. Update your RDMP as necessary to include information about where these files will be permanently stored in addition to your storage, backup, security and archiving protocols. Your code and/or analyses, interpreted data, and other outputs (e.g., figures, tables) should be continuously backed up and securely stored. Be sure to consider data privacy when making backups. Store data and code in an organized file system (for instance, using a breakdown of scripts, raw data, derived data , outputs within a large project directory) Do not alter the raw data (consider making it read-only) to have a stable separate copy    Intellectual property\n This is particularly important to discuss when the work belongs to students whose association with a particular research group may be temporary. The RDMP can help transparency around whose intellectual property this work represents. It can be useful to name a single data steward who is responsible for the maintenance of the code and data throughout its lifecycle    Metadata\n There should be adequate metadata documentation. Metadata provides information about code and data function and usage, and often takes the form of ‘README’ files in research projects. GitHub Desktop asks if you want to initialize a README file whenever you create a new repo Consider having a single readme at the minimum for the project that outlines all scripts and input data files and how they interact such that the analyses can be reproduced. At the minimum, this file should contain the project Title, Authors, Description - including of all folder subdirectories and how they relate to each other, Date, and License. GitHub allows easy association of a variety of license types with repositories - consider a license like GPL or CC-BY to ensure allowability of the reuse of your code Cryptic naming conventions in data files should be described, as well as any units and geographic transformations. If the project includes external data sources, download dates should be provided as well as any relevant filters selected. Update the metadata following any changes to the workflow    Code\n Provide software and package version information in either the metadata or in a commented header section of any script Provide annotated code with comments describing all steps taken in the analysis All figures and tables should be entirely reproducible with the code and data provided (data privacy restrictions permitting). For sensitive data, plan for appropriate anonymization and secure storage Consider using packages that guess working directories (e.g. here package for R), or using project files like .Rproj to facilitate data and code integration when the data and code are shared    Hosting\n Link the project with a platform that can provide a persistent link to the published version of the data (e.g. Zenodo link with GitHub, Dryad) in order to ensure the published results can be reproduced even as the workflow evolves. See here for how to create a Release and link with Zenodo    Naming (OSF naming guidelines)\n Consider adopting a standard file naming convention, i.e. using dashes or underscores to separate name components (avoiding special characters and spaces, especially) Use the most informative naming as possible within all project components (including variable names in code). Number or date scripts so that they order themselves meaningfully (i.e. by order of use or version number)    Appendix 1. Connecting to a remote server via SSH (in case you want to sync your GitHub repo with a server for backup or computing power) #   Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T on Ubuntu, Command+Space on Mac to bring up Spotlight and search for Terminal, or use the Windows Start menu and look for Windows Powershell or Command Prompt) Type ssh user@hostname for the remote machine you want to connect to  EmmaH:~/$ ssh ehudgins@nature-vm04.carleton.ca  Enter your password when prompted, (be prepared to say Yes to yet another message about a fingerprint) Navigate to the directory where your script is stored (maybe you transfered it there with FileZilla?) using cd  Appendix 2.
